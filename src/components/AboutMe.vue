          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="paragraph rounded">
            &nbsp; My name is Polat Coban, and I am from Turkey.
            I moved to the United States to obtain my masters degree
            in computer science from St. Maryâ€™s University.
            My passion is to create systems to enable people to
            fulfill their needs. While in college,
            i found learning aspects of computer science
            and related fields, such as electrical engineering,
            thrilling and inspiring. Since graduation,
            I have been working as a software developer in Boerne, TX.
            During my career, i have worked with a wide range of
            platforms and languages (C#, SQL, WCF, Windows Forms,
            UWP, XML, Java, JS, MangoDB, PostgreSQL).Recently,
            i have been focusing on becoming a Full Stack Engineer
            using systems such as SQL,ExpressJS,Vue-CLI, and
            NodeJS Stack. Along with these technologies, i
            have special interests in Machine Learning
            and Artificial Intelligence.
            <br>&nbsp; Aside from my career,
            I love being active as well as enjoy video games.
            I train martial arts to keep me in shape.
            Discipline and philosophy of training is
            something so valuable that i believe
            everyone has to taste it at some point in their lives.
            Lastly, my wife and I love to travel.
            Recently, we embarked on a road trip through Colorado.
            Our favorite spot was Hanging Lake. It was a long climb,
            but it totally worth it. Our small family includes
            an elderly puppy retriever, Charlie, and our new puppy, Maximus.
